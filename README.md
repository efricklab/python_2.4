## 2.4 Lab â€“ Hello World in Python (GitHub Codespaces Version)

### **Introduction**

"Hello, World!" is the traditional first program written by people learning to code. This lab will guide you through creating, editing, and running your first Python script in **GitHub Codespaces** â€” a cloud-based development environment that requires no software installation.

---

### **Objectives**

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

* Create a Python script using the GitHub Codespaces environment.
* Write and understand a simple Python program.
* Run a Python script using the integrated terminal.

---

### **Lab Steps**

---

### **Step 1: Launch GitHub Codespaces**

1. Navigate to your repository for this lab.
2. Click the green **"Code"** button, then choose the **"Codespaces"** tab.
3. Click **"Create codespace on main"**.
4. Wait for the environment to load.

> ðŸ’¡ You will now be in a browser-based version of Visual Studio Code with Python pre-installed.

---

### **Step 2: Create Your Python Script**

1. In the file explorer on the left, open the file `hello_world.py`.

---

### **Step 3: Write the Hello World Program**

Verify the following code into `hello_world.py`:

```python
# hello_world.py

# This is a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.

# The print() function displays the specified message to the screen.
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the file by pressing **Ctrl+S** or **File > Save**.

---

### **Step 4: Run the Python Script**

1. Open the terminal by going to **Terminal > New Terminal** or pressing **Ctrl + \`**.
2. In the terminal, type the following command and press Enter:

```bash
python3 hello_world.py
```

3. You should see the output:

```
Hello, World!
```

---

### **Step 5: Modify the Script**

1. Add more print statements to your file so it looks like this:

```python
# hello_world.py

print("Hello, World!")
print("Welcome to Python programming!")
print("This is your first Python script.")
```

2. Save the file.

---

### **Step 6: Run the Modified Script**

In the terminal, run the script again:

```bash
python3 hello_world.py
```

You should now see:

```
Hello, World!
Welcome to Python programming!
This is your first Python script.
```

---

### **Summary**

In this lab, you launched GitHub Codespaces, created and edited your first Python script, and ran it using the integrated terminal. You started with the classic "Hello, World!" program and expanded it with your own messages. This is your first step toward writing real Python applications in a professional cloud-based environment.
